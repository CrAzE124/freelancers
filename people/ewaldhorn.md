# Ewald Horn

## Personal blurb

I enjoy solving interesting challenges using Flutter and Dart on Android and on occasion iOS. Sometimes I build native apps, sometimes I build PWA's, all depending on what the best solution is to fit the budget and time constraints of a project. My preference is to work remotely via technologies like Slack, Skype, Zoom and Trello.

## Skill Set

Primary skills:

* Android Native
* Kotlin
* Dart
* Flutter
* Xamarin

In the past, I've worked in JavaScript, NativeScript, Java (ME, SE, EE), Scala, Swift, Python, C, C++, PHP, HTML5, Delphi, Objective-C and some time ago, Cobol.
See my LinkedIn or About.Me pages for more information.

## Time Availability

Flexible, with a strong preference for remote work.
